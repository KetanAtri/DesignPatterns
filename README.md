# DesignPatterns
Template implementation of Design Patterns learnt as part of Udemy course

<b> Solid Principles </b>
<ul>
    <li>Single Responsibility - There should only be one reason for a class to change</li>
    <li>Open-Closed Principle - Any component should be open for extension but closed for modification</li>
    <li>Liskov's Substitution - Using child class where base class is expected should not change behavior</li>
    <li>Interface Segregation - Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces that they don't use</li>
    <li>Dependency Inversion - High level module should not depend on low-level module for implementation; both should 
    depend on abstractions. Abstractions should not depend on details but vice versa.</li>
</ul>

<b> Types of Design Patterns</b>
<ul>
    <li>Creational - Used for creation of objects</li>
    <li>Structural - Used for arrangement / composition of classes / objects</li>
    <li>Behavioral - Used to determine how the classes / objects communicate with each other</li>
</ul>
<b>Additional Notes</b>
<ul>
    <li>Importance of test cases - Unit test cases, like JUnit, help to make refactoring easier. Any changes in
    functionality can be easily detected by the unit test cases.</li>
    <li>Empty or dummy implementations are an indication of interface pollution</li>
</ul>
